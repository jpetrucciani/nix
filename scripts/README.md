# scripts

This directory contains various random scripts that I use in this repo, or in packages created by this repo.

## In this directory

### [git-trim.sh](./git-trim.sh)

This script allows us to trim the git branches.

### [nixup.sh](./nixup.sh)

This script is a shorthand to load up nix (on non-nixos linux, windows with WSL2, or mac) and configure some basic things. You can run this by doing:

```bash
curl -L https://cobi.dev/nixup | bash
```
