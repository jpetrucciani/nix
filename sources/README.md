This directory contains rev/sha256 combos for any of the other repos that I track and pin in this repo. These are automatically updated with GitHub actions!

## [home-manager.json](./home-manager.json)

This json file tracks my pinned version of [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

## [kwb.json](./kwb.json)

This json file tracks my pinned version of [Chief Keef's nix repo](https://github.com/kwbauson/cfg).

## [nixpkgs.json](./nixpkgs.json)

This json file tracks my pinned version of [nixpkgs proper](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). Currently, I track the `nixpkgs-unstable` branch, and GitHub actions will auto pull the latest rev/sha256 nightly and test with my configurations.
